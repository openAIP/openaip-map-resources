# OpenAIP Map Resources

This repository contains resources related to OpenAIP's map style powered by (https://mapbox.com)[Mapbox].

The repository is intended to give interested users access to the OpenAIP style definition and the used SVGs to get started with their
own map style faster. Please note that OpenAIP uses a dataset that is streamlined and optimazed for this purpose which 
is not availalbe to the public. Thus the style will **not work out of the box**! It is a place to serve as a starting ground and get an
idea about how to create and structure a map style using the (https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/guides/)[Mapbox Style Specification]. 

This package only includes the OpenAIP style and **not** the basemap style. Mapbox provides a generous free tier to provide a custom basemap style
that can complement your own aviation related style.
